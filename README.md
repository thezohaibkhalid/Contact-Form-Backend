# üì¨ Contact Form with File Upload, Google Drive Integration & Email Notifications

Welcome to the **Contact Form with File Upload, Google Drive Integration & Email Notifications** project! üéâ This project allows users to submit their contact information, upload a file, and automatically save that file to Google Drive. Additionally, an email notification is sent to the user each time someone submits a message via the contact form.

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Contact Form Submission** üìù
Users can submit their contact details (like name, email, and message) through a simple contact form. Once submitted, the data is securely processed and stored in a MongoDB database.

### 4. **Saving to Google Drive** üåê
Once the file is uploaded, it is automatically saved to a designated folder in Google Drive. The folder ID can be easily configured in the `.env` file.
